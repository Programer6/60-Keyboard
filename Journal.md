I spent most of the day in KiCad, laying out the schematic.
I designed a 5-row by 14-column key matrix. Each switch is paired with a 1N4148 diode to prevent "ghosting," which is when the keyboard thinks you've pressed keys you haven't. I also added support for two rotary encoders (for volume/scrolling) and two I2C connectors for OLED screens. 
I double-checked all my connections, and everything seems to be in order.

The plan is to use a Raspberry Pi Pico as the microcontroller because it's powerful, cheap, and has great community support with KMK firmware.
