# 60%-Keyboard

I built this 60% keyboard with KMK firmware because I wanted a compact, minimal layout that saves space without sacrificing functionality. Full-sized keyboards felt bulky for my setup! This my first keyboad which I designeed so I wanted to keep think simple..

# PCB
- The PCB's size is
- 61x key default 60% Layout!
- 2x Rotary Encoder
